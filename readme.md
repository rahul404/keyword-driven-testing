# Keyword-Driven Testing
>A keyword-driven framework is a table-driven testing or action word based testing. It is a software testing method suitable for both manual and automated testing. 
A keyword-driven testing is a scripting technique that uses data files to contain the keywords related to the application being tested. These keywords describe the set of actions that is required to perform a specific step.
 keyword-driven test consists of high and low-level keywords, including the keyword arguments, which is composed to describe the action of a test case.
In Keyword Driven Testing, you first identify a set of keywords and then associate an action (or function) related to these keywords. Here, every testing action like opening or closing of browser, mouse click, keystrokes, etc. is described by a keyword such as openbrowser, click, Typtext and so on.

In this sample, we have made use selenium web driver to access browser and Apache POI to read instructions( keyword ) form excel sheet.
